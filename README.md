## **About The Project**

**Politicool** is a mobile app created to inspire and empower young voters by gamifying the civic education experience. It addresses the knowledge gaps and disinterest often seen in youth voting patterns by providing an engaging, interactive, and rewarding platform.

**Inspiration**  
The idea for Politicool was born from the recognition that young people often feel disconnected from politics. By transforming civic education into a fun, gamified experience, Politicool aims to bridge the gap and make informed voting an exciting part of their routine.
